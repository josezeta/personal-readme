### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## How to work JosÃ© Sepulveda

### My work hours:
Starting my date with some time for. answering emails, editing projects, writing project docs, HR tasks, etc. You can reach me by Slack during these times

My working hours are usually 8 to 6ish, I'm available by Slack pretty much 24/7 (but I do NOT expect the same from my team). Do not hesitate to call in the middle of the night if that is important.

When I'm on vacation, Nobody will able to reach me i will usually go to the desert with no celullar reception.

### Whatâ€™s the best way to communicate with me?

I prefer Slack to email, but if I don't respond, email is a great follow up.

*If I donâ€™t respond, try:* Follow up email, or ping me again on Slack. Don't feel bad about bugging me (you're not). For breaking news/emergencies, reach me by text or phone call.

### What makes me grumpy?
I also have a strong aversion to unstructured meetings. Protips: send out an agenda, make sure everyone has an opportunity to be heard, and establish clear action items before folks leave the room.

Don't like talk about personal matters during working hours(or company related meetings) but i'm totally ok by doing so on non company related matters.


### How do I like to give feedback?
I also prefer giving feedback in a 1:1 context (versus large meetings), so I may follow up with you after a bigger meeting.


### How do I like to receive feedback?
I prefer in person, but slack and email are totally great if that's the way you're most comfortable communicating. Sometimes it's easier to get things in writing and then have a follow up conversation.

I am very open to hearing feedback **anytime**. If there's something I can do to make your work easier, or something I'm doing is causing you stress, PLEASE speak up. If you're not comfortable chatting with me directly. Do not hesitate to do it directly, i will take as impersonal possible.

### One of my goals for the coming year:
Break the conform zone by getting new challengelles.


### Topics Iâ€™m always happy to talk about:
Artificial Intelligence effects in humanity, extraterrestrial life, math, science, Privacy.
