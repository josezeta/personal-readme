### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## How to work JosÃ© SepÃºlveda

### My work hours:
Starting my date with some time for. reading emails, review PRs, some coding. You can reach me by Slack during these times (There is a block between 10 AM and 11 AM in which i will not able to slack back, critical decision making in booked for that time).

My working hours are usually 9 to 6ish, I'm available by Slack pretty much 24/7 (I do not really care about it but I do NOT expect the same from my team). Do not hesitate to call in the middle of the night if that is important.

When I'm on vacation, I will be available for urgent things. It's definition depends on what I'm working on at the time, but you can ask the following questions to determine it.

* Can the team handle it. If so, just do it
* Is the issue affecting a production environment
* Which is the severity of the issue
* Is there any unrecoverable decision that need to be made.

### Whatâ€™s the best way to communicate with me?

I prefer Slack to email, but if I don't respond, email is a great follow up.

*If I donâ€™t respond, try:* Follow-up email, or ping me again on Slack. Don't feel bad about bugging me (you're not). For breaking news/emergencies, reach me by text or phone call.

### What makes me grumpy?
I have a strong aversion to unstructured meetings. Protips: send out an agenda, make sure everyone has an opportunity to be heard, and establish clear action items before folks leave the room.

Don't like talk about personal matters during working hours(except for meeting or gatherings in which the specific goal is know each others).


### How do I like to give feedback?
I like giving feedback in a 1:1 context (versus large meetings), so I may follow up with you after a bigger meeting.


### How do I like to receive feedback?
I prefer in person, but slack and email are totally great if that's the way you're most comfortable communicating. Sometimes it's easier to get things in writing and then have a follow up conversation.

I am very open to hearing feedback **anytime**. If there's something I can do to make your work easier, or something I'm doing is causing you stress, PLEASE speak up. Do not hesitate to do it directly.

### One of my goals for the coming year:
Break the conform zone by getting new challenges.

### Topics Iâ€™m always happy to talk about:
Artificial Intelligence effects in humanity, extraterrestrial life, math, science, Privacy related topics.
